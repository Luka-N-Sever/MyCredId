# MyCredId

Overly complex app that uses internal sqlite dummy data.
The idea is simple, users select a city and then a credential to activate for that city.
The credential that they want to use is then activated, and the hardware of a parking lot
lets the user in with that credential.
There are some extras such as credential details, parking lot details, and credential purchasing.
Credential activation is not implemented nor is purchasing.
